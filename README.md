# Fresh proxy list

whether the REMOTE_ADDR has been change using 'https://www.httpbin.org/ip' and stores
them into list. Writing 'proxyList' into file is also supported

    init_proxy_list(limit) - main routine, initializes proxyList.
                            'limit' arg  is optional, it defines
                            how many proxies to store.
    
    write_to_file() - write 'proxyList' to file. 'proxyList' must
                      contain at least one entry.

# Usage example

    import FreshProxyList as proxy      # import module

    proxy.init_proxy_list(5)            # get 5 proxies
    proxy.write_to_file()               # write them to file

    print('\n\nFresh proxies:\n')
